# Hello Markdown!

It is **soo** nice to be able to write in this simnple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remeber the basic syntax
* Write your Doc
*Done!

Now you can be a wix at this language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");'

Can't remember the language? No Problem! Just visit one of these resources:
